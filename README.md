# Pok√©mon EV Calculator (Vanilla JS)

An interactive web application to calculate Pok√©mon EV (Effort Value) distribution based on your desired stats, available items (Vitamins, Mochi, Feathers), and in-game currencies. It helps optimize item usage and plan purchases to reach your EV goals efficiently.

**This version is built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind via CDN), and Vanilla JavaScript, making it directly deployable on platforms like GitHub Pages without any build process.**

## üåü Key Features

*   **Comprehensive EV Configuration:**
    *   Set Current EVs for your Pok√©mon.
    *   Define Target EVs for each stat (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed) using intuitive sliders.
    *   Visual progress bar for Total Target EVs, preventing allocation beyond the 510 maximum.
    *   Individual stat cap of 252 EVs enforced.
    *   "Reset All Target EVs" button for quick clearing.
*   **Inventory Management:**
    *   Input quantities for owned Vitamins, Mochi, and Feathers.
    *   Collapsible sections for easy organization.
    *   Quick increment/decrement buttons (+/-) for item quantities.
*   **Currency Tracking:**
    *   Enter your available Pok√© Dollars and League Points.
    *   Vitamins are priced at 10,000 (Pok√© Dollars or LP).
*   **Smart Item Optimization & Purchase Planning:**
    *   The calculator first utilizes your existing inventory (Vitamins, then Mochi, then Feathers) to meet EV goals.
    *   If owned items are insufficient, it suggests purchasing the required Vitamins.
    *   **Granular Purchase Logic:**
        *   Calculates the exact number of Vitamins needed per stat.
        *   Checks affordability against your combined currencies (Pok√© Dollars prioritized).
        *   If you can't afford all suggested Vitamins for a stat, it tells you how many you *can* buy with remaining funds.
        *   Clearly indicates any partial purchases and the remaining quantity/cost needed for that specific item.
*   **Detailed & User-Friendly Results:**
    *   **Overall Status:** Clear message indicating if EV goals were met.
    *   **Purchase Overview:** Summarizes total ideal cost, actual amount spent, and total additional currency needed if goals aren't fully met.
    *   **Per-Stat Breakdown:** Details items used from inventory and Vitamins to purchase (including partial/unaffordable).
    *   **Important Notes & Warnings:** Highlights any shortfalls or issues.
*   **Visual Appeal:**
    *   Uses item sprites from PokeAPI where available, with emoji fallbacks.
    *   Themed colors for stats and UI elements (via Tailwind CSS).
    *   Responsive design.
